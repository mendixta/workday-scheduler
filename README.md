# Workday Scheduler 
 
# Summary: 
For this assignment, we were asked to create a planner for a user who has a busy schedule so they can track down their tasks by the hour. This planner was also supposed to include:

*  The time and date to display and for it be connected to the timeblocks 
*  The colors red, green, and gray to represent "current, past, and future"
*  The ability to save tasks even after the webpage was refreshed

The end result was this: https://mendixta.github.io/workday-scheduler/


# Getting Started: 
We were provided with a somewhat ready HTML and CSS file for our project, it was just up to us to add a working JavaScipt file as well as the Timeblocks to the HTML.

* Getting the Timeblocks to display:
One of the very first things that I began with was creating the timeblocks in the html using past resources to reference myself on, that is, using past class activities. In the very beggining of the project, I used "forms" and added a save button along with it, which in the end, didn't really work out / didnt look much like the mockup. Creating the Timeblocks was a lot of trial and error, and honestly one of the more time consuming things about this project. I would fix or add something to the html timeblocks and certain things would stop working or the whole website would just look funny. After a little google searching, I found some methods to create timeblocks as well as a save button that looked just like the mockup. Creating a timeblock seemed a lot simpler after actually doing a little research. 


* Actually getting tasks to save:
As you can see, I didn't get very much done when it came to the JavaScript, I struggled a lot to even get anything to save when I would refresh the page to begin with, and then when it came actually connecting the "time-display" to the timeblocks, I struggled way too much with it. I couldn't even get the time or date to display.      


* Messing with the CSS: 
There wasn't really much that I did with the CSS, just like with the JavaScript, I experimented with it just to see what went with what.


# Final Thoughts:
Before even starting on this project, I didn't think it was going to be as time consuming as it actually turned out to be, but when I actually began to work on it, that's when it hit me that this was going to be a not so easy task. I feel like I spent a lot of time experimenting with the code seeing what works and what doesn't, which I learned a couple new tricks by doing so, but I didn't get where I wanted to be when it comes to the final result.
